# Helium_recovery
Low pressure recovery system accumulating helium diring 8-12h and realeasing it within 3-5 minutes into the main recovery system.
A set of Milyar ballons are slowly filled by evaporation helium from NMR spectrometers.  When flushing the helium in the main recovery system, adjascent ballons are filled with low-pressure compressed air (about 10 mB). More details in other documents...
