# Helium_recovery
Low pressure helium recovery system. It is accumulating helium during 8-12h and releasing it within 3-5 minutes into a main recovery system. This was developped because of small leaks in the system imposing a mimial flow to recover it.
A set of Milyar ballons are slowly filled by evaporation helium from three NMR spectrometers. When flushing the helium in the main recovery system, adjascent ballons (fixed by tape) are filled with the facility compressed air (pressured reduced to about 10 mB). More details in other documents of this repository (in particular the .ai file and the [arduino code](https://github.com/Gr-Jeannerat-unige/Helium_recovery/blob/master/ardiuno_code/system_2019_Esplora_code/EsploraTemperaturechiorg_helium_recovery.ino)).
